# Tankbot-3D-Model-Data
The 3D model data for the project in .stl form that can be compiled into .gcode for the specific 3D printer intended for use in fabricating the components. The ".gcode" files resulting from the compiling (AKA "Slicing process") are very detailed, machine-level instructions for constructing the object in the tangible world. Compiled .gcode files for 3D printing the digital models (originally in .stl or another popular format) that a 3D printer uses.

Print specifications:
- 1.75mm PLA Filament
- 210 C for extruder temp, 70 C for bed temp
- 0.1mm layer height with 60% infill density
- Fasten with metric hex screws (mainly 3mm, 4mm, 5mm diameter with depths varying from 10mm to 18mm)

Margins for error are tight to ensure proper and sturdy design so best outcome's most likely to follow those parameters for printer calibration^
